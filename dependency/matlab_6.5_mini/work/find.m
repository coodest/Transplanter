%FIND   Find indices of nonzero elements.
%   I = FIND(X) returns the indices of the vector X that are
%   non-zero. For example, I = FIND(A>100), returns the indices
%   of A where A is greater than 100. See RELOP.
% 
%   [I,J] = FIND(X) returns the row and column indices of
%   the nonzero entries in the matrix X.  This is often used
%   with sparse matrices.
% 
%   [I,J,V] = FIND(X) also returns a vector containing the
%   nonzero entries in X.  Note that find(X) and find(X~=0)
%   will produce the same I and J, but the latter will produce
%   a V with all 1's.
